Porcupine WSGI connector
------------------------

Porcupine connector for WSGI servers. Apart from the connector itself
(WSGIConnector.py), we also provide a simple WSGI server based on wsgiref.
Start it by typing:

  python wsgiServer.py

This server by default is listening to the port 1088. The Porcupine connector
is bound to the root folder of the server. The Porcupine desktop is accessible
by typing:

  http://localhost:1088

Enjoy!
