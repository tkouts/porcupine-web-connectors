Porcupine WSGI connector
------------------------

Porcupine connector for WSGI servers. Apart from the connector itself
(WSGIConnector.py), we also provide a simple WSGI server based on WSGIUtils.
To use this server you should download and install WSGIUtils from
http://www.owlfish.com/software/wsgiutils/index.html and simply start it
by typing:

  python wsgiServer.py

This server by default is listening to the port 1088. The Porcupine connector
is bound to the root folder of the server. The Porcupine desktop is accessible
by typing:

  http://localhost:1088

Enjoy!
